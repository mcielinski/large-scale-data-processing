## Task 4
Create a docker-compose manifest with 2 containers, which communicate with each other.
For example use a `nginx` docker for hosting some content and another `curl` container, 
which checks if the resource is available. Use docker-compose version 3 and following 
service attributes:
- `links`
- `restarts`
- `resources`
```bash
docker-compose up
```
